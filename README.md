**Basic. Functional. Typed. Data Structures.**

Functional typed data structures offering structure clarity and simplicity.

## Packages

Each package contains a data structure

| Name                                      | Description                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **[Linked List](/packages/linked-list/)** | A linear structure with each data input pointing to the next input |
| **[Queue](/packages/queue)** | An ordered structure of data inputs obeying the principle of first in, first out  |
| **[Stack](/packages/stack)** | An ordered structure of data inputs obeying the principle of last in, first out |

## Why

Improving on data structures is important. Day-to-day, engineering work doesn't deal with data structures. The repository attempts to provide the simpliest approach to data structures in JavaScript by making each structure functional and typed, but not too much.

## Cites

There are many repositories demonstrating data structures in JavaScript. Here are a few: [datastructures-js](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/) by [Eyas Ranjous](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous), [JS Shelf](https://github.com/js-shelf), [Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures/) by [James Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds), [Bucke-JS](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS) by [Mauricio Santos](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS).

There are many online classes dedicated to teaching data structures in JavaScript. Here are a few: [Kyle Shevlin](https://github.com/kyleshevlin)'s [data structures](https://egghead.io/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript) class on Egg Head, [Algo Expert](algoexpert.io) is a tool for testing algorithm and data structure knowledge!
