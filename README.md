#### Basic. Functional. Typed. Data Structures.

*Functional typed data structures offering clarity and simplicity.

## Packages

Each package contains a data structure

| Name                                      | Description                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **[Linked List](/packages/linked-list/)** ⛓ | A linear structure inputs, each input pointing to the next |
| **[Queue](/packages/queue)** ➡️➡️ | An ordered structure of first in, first out inputs |
| **[Stack](/packages/stack)** 🥞 | An ordered structure of last in, first out inputs  |
| **[Graph](/packages/graph)** 📈📉 | A collection of vertices related by edges |

## Why

#### Improving on data structures is important! Day-to-day, engineering work doesn't deal with data structures. 

This repository attempts to provide the simpliest approach to data structures in JavaScript by making each structure functional and typed, but not too much; very little in fact.

## Cites

#### There are many repositories demonstrating data structures in JavaScript. 

Here are a few: [datastructures-js](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/) by [Eyas Ranjous](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous), [JS Shelf](https://github.com/js-shelf), [Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures/) by [James Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds), [Bucke-JS](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS) by [Mauricio Santos](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS).

#### There are many online classes dedicated to teaching data structures in JavaScript. 

Here are a few: [Kyle Shevlin](https://github.com/kyleshevlin)'s [data structures](https://egghead.io/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript) class on Egg Head, [Algo Expert](algoexpert.io) is a tool for testing algorithm and data structure knowledge!

- **Functional:** In an effort to get this ish, done, there may be a little bit of non-functional stuff.
