Data structures built with TypeScript offering more clarity into each structure

## Packages

Each package contains a common data structure

| Name                                      | Description                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **[Linked List](/packages/linked-list/)** | A Linear Structure of Nodes |
