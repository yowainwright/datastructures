> **Data Structures in TypeScript:** if learning Types wasn't enough, the repo adds datastructures to it. 😳 But, hopefully, it is for the better.

This project builds Data Structures with TypeScript. Each modules is it's own datastructure and can be used in the wild. **Please** feel free to submit pull requests for more usable datastructures.

Most initial commits were done  looking at repos such as [this](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/) by Eyas Ranjous, then crying a bit. Then trying to figued out how to best create and use a datastructure in JavaScript and how to best define that datastructure with TypeScript.

## Data Structures

The list below contains common Data Structures.

Each list item provides links to help go from **"what the f\**k?"** to **"Duh, obviously simply trivial."**. Kidding. Each list item provides a bit of context, links to code, references, and finally—a usable module for each data structure.

## Linked List

 > The [Link List](/packages/linked-list/) is one of the most common Data Structures. Ask any developer about it if you would like to instantly feel like an idiot.

The [Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) is a Linear Structure of Nodes. Each Node is a seperate object. Go to [DataStructures TS, Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) for more detail.
