> **Data Structures in TypeScript:** This monorepo project implements common data structures using TypeScript. 

Each package of the monorepo contains a common data structure. **Please** submit pull requests for more usable data structures.

There are many popular repositories which demonstrate data structures in JavaScript. Here are a few:

- **[datastructures-js](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous/datastructures-js/)** by [Eyas Ranjous](https://github.com/eyas-ranjous), [JS Shelf](https://github.com/js-shelf)
- **[Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures/)** by [James Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds)

## Data Structures

The list below contains common Data Structures provided by this Repository in separate packages.

Each list item links to a package of a data structure which will hopefully help you go from **"what the f\**k?"** to **"Duh, obviously simply trivial."**. Kidding. Each list item provides a bit of context, links to package of data structure containing references and, finally, a usable module which you can review and use to understand the data structure.

## Linked List

 > The [Link List](/packages/linked-list/) is one of the most common Data Structures. Ask any developer about it if you would like to instantly feel like an idiot.

![Linked List Illustration](https://jeffry.in/assets/datastructures-ts/linked-list-il.svg)

The [Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) is a Linear Structure of Nodes. Each Node is a seperate object. Go to [DataStructures TS, Linked List](/packages/linked-list/) for more detail.
